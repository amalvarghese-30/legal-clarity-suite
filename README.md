# Legal Clarity Suite

```STILLWORKS LEGALOS — MASTER BUILD PROMPT
ROLE & OBJECTIVE
You are a Senior Product Designer + Frontend Architect building StillWorks LegalOS — a premium legal practice management system. This is NOT a generic admin dashboard. Design a luxury enterprise SaaS application that looks like it cost ₹20-30 lakhs to build, inspired by Apple, Vercel, and premium SaaS products.

CORE PHILOSOPHY
Simplicity over complexity — show only what users need

Premium ≠ complex — avoid Jira/Slack/Salesforce density

One screen, one primary goal — every page answers one question

Progressive disclosure — hide advanced controls until needed

Visual calm — lots of whitespace, soft shadows, rounded cards, minimal borders

Enterprise luxury — everything feels handcrafted

TARGET USERS (NON-TECHNICAL)
Senior Advocates, Junior Advocates, Legal Assistants, Clerks, Office Administrators, Reception Staff, Partners

DESIGN LANGUAGE
40% Apple + 25% Vercel + 20% Premium SaaS + 15% Glassmorphism/Neumorphism

Glass only on: Sidebar, Header, Dialogs, Search, Quick Actions, Notifications — NEVER entire pages

CODING RULES
Maximum 250-300 lines per component

Reusable everything — never duplicate code

Custom hooks for repeated logic

TypeScript strict mode everywhere

Lazy loading + code splitting

Memoization where beneficial

GPU-accelerated animations (transform/opacity only)

Design tokens for all values (never hardcode colors/spacing/radius)

RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS
Mobile: <640px (bottom nav, single column, tables → cards, dialogs fullscreen)

Tablet: 640-1024px (collapsed sidebar, 2-column grid)

Desktop: 1024-1440px (floating sidebar, full layout)

Large: 1440px+ (max-width 1600px container)

Touch targets minimum 44px

NEVER simply shrink desktop — redesign for each breakpoint

ACCESSIBILITY
Keyboard navigation, visible focus rings, ARIA labels, screen reader support, high contrast text, 44px+ click targets, reduce motion support

QUALITY CHECKLIST (ask before every screen)
Does this feel premium and handcrafted?

Can a non-technical lawyer understand it immediately?

Would Apple simplify this further?

Is it using design tokens (not hardcoded values)?

Are animations 150-250ms with proper easing?

Is spacing generous (not cramped)?

Are empty/loading/error states handled?

BUILD ORDER (sequential phases)
Foundation: Project setup, design tokens, global styles, theme, fonts

Design System: All reusable components (buttons, cards, dialogs, inputs, tables, charts, timeline, toast, search, sidebar, nav, skeletons, badges, avatars, accordions, tabs, breadcrumbs, upload, progress)

Layout: Sidebar, top nav, hero wrapper, responsive grid, page container

Authentication: Login, forgot password, reset

```FINAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES & QUALITY STANDARDS

The entire application must be built using a centralized Design Token system rather than hardcoded values. All colors, typography, spacing, border radii, shadows, animation durations, opacity values, breakpoints, and other visual properties should be managed through reusable CSS variables or theme tokens to ensure complete consistency, maintainability, and scalability across the entire product.

Motion should never exist purely for decoration. Every animation must have a purpose—to explain an interaction, guide user attention, confirm an action, reduce cognitive load, or create a subtle sense of delight. Animations should feel natural, fluid, and refined, inspired by Apple's interaction design. Every transition, hover state, dialog, page change, and loading sequence should reinforce confidence without becoming distracting or overwhelming.

The interface should include subtle premium details that collectively create the feeling of a high-end enterprise product. This includes intelligent search suggestions, contextual tooltips, elegant segmented controls, soft gradient borders where appropriate, floating utility widgets, premium toggle switches, polished empty states, refined loading experiences, carefully designed status indicators, and thoughtful micro-details that make the software feel handcrafted rather than template-generated.

The emotional experience of using the software is just as important as its functionality. Users should feel calm, organized, confident, efficient, and in control throughout every workflow. The interface should reduce stress, improve focus, and make complex legal operations feel simple and intuitive. Every interaction should reinforce professionalism, trust, and reliability.

Before finalizing any screen, apply the Luxury Test. Ask: Would Apple ship this interface? Would Vercel approve this level of polish? Does this feel handcrafted rather than generated? Is there unnecessary complexity? Can the layout be simplified further? If the answer to any of these questions is no, redesign the screen until it reaches the expected quality standard.

Every screen should follow a set of universal design principles. Each page must have one clear primary objective, common actions should require no more than three clicks, advanced functionality should follow progressive disclosure rather than overwhelming users immediately, and whitespace should be treated as an essential design element that improves readability, hierarchy, and overall visual balance rather than as empty space.

Micro-interactions should be implemented consistently throughout the application. Buttons should provide subtle tactile feedback, cards should gently lift with soft shadows on hover, cursor states should clearly communicate interactivity, success actions should feel satisfying, uploads should include elegant completion animations, toast notifications should appear and disappear smoothly, timelines should reveal information progressively, search interactions should feel responsive, and skeleton loading should replace generic loading spinners with premium shimmer effects.

The component library should be comprehensive and completely reusable. Every button, card, table, dialog, drawer, tab, accordion, breadcrumb, floating action button, timeline, progress indicator, status pill, context menu, tooltip, dropdown, search component, empty state, loading skeleton, notification, chart, avatar, and form control must belong to a single unified design system with consistent styling, spacing, animations, and interaction patterns. No page should introduce components that deviate from the established design language.

Finally, every module should pass a complete quality assurance review before being considered finished. Verify that navigation is intuitive, dashboards prioritize actionable information over unnecessary statistics, case and client workflows remain clear and organized, typography and spacing are consistent, accessibility requirements are met, responsive layouts work flawlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, performance remains smooth with optimized loading behavior, animations enhance usability rather than distract, and the overall experience feels cohesive, polished, and production-ready. The completed application should present itself as a premium legal operating system that immediately inspires confidence, reflects exceptional craftsmanship, and impresses clients from the very first interaction.```
